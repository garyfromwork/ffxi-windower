Purpose: 
	To make navigating FFXI's zones a bit easier for new players, and save players
 	from alt-tabbing to various websites to see how zones connect.

Commands:
	Load the addon:
		//lua l gps
	Find exits for current zone:
		//gps zone
	Find exits for a specific zone (don't include quotes):
		//gps "zone name" 

Known Issues:
	This addon currently cannot process auto-translated phrases or zone names.
	A work around is to auto-translate the zone name in game and backspace a few characters and then retype them.
	This removes the auto-translate but keeps the name of the zone.
