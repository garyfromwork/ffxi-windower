VoidWalker

Overview: This Windower Addon tracks the distance you've traveled in yalms from the last place you /healed.
It is designed to more accurately track down Voidwalker NM distances. If you receive a reading with a distance and direction
the addon will also turn your character to face the appropriate direction.

Instructions for use: Create a folder in your Windower/Addons directory named VoidWalker, then paste in the VoidWalker.lua.
In game type //lua l voidwalker, this loads the addon in game. To confirm it's working, simply /heal in game then start walking.

Addon commands:
  //vw help (displays all commands for the addon, currently only "on/off"
  //vw on/off this turns on or off the distance tracking. When //vw off the distance counter won't increase while moving.

To unload the addon: //lua u voidwalker

Please enjoy!
